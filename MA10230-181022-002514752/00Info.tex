\subsection*{Overview and Aims}

\emph{Semester 1:} MA10230 Methods and Applications 1A: Calculus

\emph{Semester 2:} MA10236 Methods and Applications 1B: Vectors and Mechanics

\begin{itemize}
\item Revise integration, and use integration techniques to integrate a variety of functions.
\item Introduce calculus in several variables: partial differentiation, double and triple integrals.
\item Introduce various types of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
\item Show how these methods help us solve many problems arising in applications.
% Possibly say something about the fields that these applications arise in, since I might not be saying anything about that later.
\item Provide foundations for Mechanics in Semester 2.
\item Links with Analysis -- which explains the maths behind the methods.
\end{itemize}
