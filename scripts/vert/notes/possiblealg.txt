Context is:
* Between dollars
* On the line
* In the cell
* Is between {} a context?
** What about \{\}?
** Or any other matching sets of brackets? Probably it needs to be for safety purposes e.g. bra ket notation 

This is a do no harm algorithm. It requires us to work within contexts which could be nested.

If we are not within mathematical text then do nothing
If we are within verbatim text then do nothing

If there is already \left \right \bigl \bigr \Bigl \Bigr \biggl \biggr \Biggl \Biggr or similar directory before the vert like symbol then do not count this

If there is a single |, \|, \vert or \Vert within the context then do nothing.

If there is a single pair of |, \|, \vert or \Vert within the context then apply left and right and append a warning comment.

If there is a sequence of |...| operator |...| operator |...| then apply left and right and append a warning comment. This will only work for the list of operators we come up with.

In all other situations append a correction request.
