I believe that all problem cases come down to:

|...|...|...|

which could be:
\left|...\right|...\left|...\right|

or
\left|...\left|...\right|...\right|

I do not believe that these are syntactically differentiable.

This is THE ambiguity and it exists _IN LATEX_!!

The LaTeX compiler cannot distinguish and this leads to incorrect spacing which apparently NO ONE notices.

So. Can we spot this, warn and abort and fix all others?

Their example is |k|=|-k| (e.g. vs |2|k|-k|

We would need to decide, once and for all, what we consider to be local context. It is probably a good thing that we do this but do we have the confidence?

We would also need a complete list of all possible sizing prefixes (in all packages??).

Or, I guess that it is *possible* that the ONLY examples which led to sizing or reading problems in mathjax and/or word are these precise examples. If this is the case then why are we bothering to do anything? So. This is the first thing that we need to find out.

How?
* Trials
* Reseach
* Phone a friend

Note: LaTeX does not attempt to height match but mathjax does. This is why we see a clearer visual feedback.

Nothing is that simple. Large and mathjax agree (HTF?) and LaTeX does not. We need to check out what happens in speech and braille.
