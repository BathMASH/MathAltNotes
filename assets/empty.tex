\begin{document}
If you can see this text then you have forgotten to give an argument to make the file of your choice. For instance, if your \LaTeX~file is called \verb=file.tex= you can make all document formats using:
\begin{verbatim}
> make name=file
\end{verbatim}
You can make individual formats as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
> make standard name=file
> make clear name=file
> make large name=file
> make web name=file
> make word name=file
\end{verbatim}
Please note that the large print format does not reflow the mathematics and so anything in mathematics mode may go off the right hand side of the page.
